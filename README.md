# Flutter Card Game

### Overview

This is the final source code of the Flutter card game course available online [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSN2hBf8D5Q).

In the course, we will be solving common problems that come with building real-world applications including working with an external API using http and UI state management using the Provider package.

We'll also have some fun coding some AI for our bot players and making use of inheritance in order to support different games that run off of the same core engine.

### Core Dependencies:
